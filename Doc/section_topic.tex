\section{Introduction}
	This project is about implementing the game Pong on the Atlys Spartan-6 FPGA board. Pong is a two dimensional multiplayer game that simulates table-tennis. Each of the two players controls an in game paddle by moving it vertically in order to hit a ball back and forth. A player scores a point when the opponent fails to return the ball. 
	
	We also took advantage of the built-in HDMI port and the AC-97 Codec to produce a better image and audio quality output. 
	
	Figure \ref{board+screenshot} shows a picture of the used board, and a screenshot of the \textcolor{red}{(yet to be)} realized game.
