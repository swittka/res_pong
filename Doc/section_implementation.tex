        The Image Generator takes inputs from the players and outputs the video that can be displayed through the HDMI interface of the Atlys board. The panels shown in figure \ref{ball_wall_panel} are submodules of the module \texttt{image\_generator\_c}.
		This module calculates the movement of the ball and movement the two panels that are controlled by the players. 
		
		The movement of the ball is done by the \texttt{ball\_c} module. (see next Section for more details on implementation).
		After a well determined time frame, the ball's movement direction is determined and the next \texttt{x\_pos} and \texttt{y\_pos} are either incremented or decremented. 
		
		The module \texttt{panel\_c} determines the y-coordinate of on panel based on the player input. For instance, pressing \texttt{btn\_up} increments the \texttt{y\_pos} signal if the panel did not reach the top edge already.

    \subsection{Sound Generator}
        In order to generate sound, we used the on board LM4550 chip
