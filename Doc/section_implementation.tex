\section{Implementation}
The hardware description of the implemented game pong is devided into four modules. Firstly the video controller, which implements the VGA respectively HDMI interface so the video output can be displayed on a monitor. Additionally the image generator creates all required objects like the ball and paddles as well as their movement. Furthermore the match controller manages the interactions between the objects. Lastly the audio output is created by the sound generator module.
